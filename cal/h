Girls Who Code is a national organization whos mission is to decrease the huge gender gap in
computer science by giving girls the opportunity to learn how to code.


Our mission is to decrease the gender gap in computer science by giving girls in out community the opportunity to learn how to code.
In Gainesville many of the schools do not have a coding program. We know that coding can be stigmatized as being a "boys only" hobby or skill
causing them to not want to learn it on their own. So we want to reach out to the girls of Gainesville and show them that there are women in the field,
and also show them the power of code!
